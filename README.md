## Flowchart

## Pseudocode

BEGIN
  START TRANSACTION;

  SET @orderNumber = (SELECT MAX(orderNumber) FROM orders);

  // Assuming a loop for each product
  FOR EACH product IN products:
    SAVEPOINT before_product_1;

    // Update order details for the product
    UPDATE order_details
    SET quantityOrdered = quantityOrdered + 1,
        priceEach = (SELECT priceEach FROM products WHERE productCode = product.productCode)
    WHERE orderNumber = @orderNumber AND productCode = product.productCode;

    SAVEPOINT before_product_2;

    // Update product inventory
    UPDATE products
    SET quantityInStock = quantityInStock - 1
    WHERE productCode = product.productCode;

    // Check if quantityInStock is less than reorder level
    IF quantityInStock < reorderLevel:
      // Trigger reorder process (e.g., place an order with a supplier)
      TRIGGER_REORDER(product.productCode);

    // Commit changes for the current product
    COMMIT;

    // Handle exceptions or errors
    CATCH (exception):
      ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_product_2;
      // Log error or take corrective action
    END CATCH;

  END FOR;

  // Commit the overall transaction
  COMMIT;

  STOP;

## Support for the Sales Departments' Report
For enhancing support for the sales departmentâ€™s reporting:

Automated Error Notifications: Implement mechanisms to alert technical staff when a rollback occurs, helping quicker diagnosis and resolution.
Performance Optimization: Analyze and optimize queries to speed up transaction times, especially important during high-volume periods.
Data Integrity Checks: Regularly implement and update constraints and checks within the database to ensure the data integrity is maintained even before it hits transaction logic.
Scalability Considerations: Ensure the database and application can handle increased load as sales grow or during peak times, potentially incorporating more robust database management practices or distributed databases.
This setup seems robust for handling critical sales data, but continuous monitoring and optimization can enhance reliability and performance, directly supporting the sales department's needs.
